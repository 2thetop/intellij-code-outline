Known issues:

 * Does not scale image when file is too long (too tall) to fit
 * Does not deal well with deleting large amounts of text when file is too
   long to fit
 * Only useful as tool window on right and left; should be rotated when on
   top or bottom
 * Does not use IDEA's colors
 * Has problems when closing tab groups (to fix, switch to another editor
   then back to previous editor)

Due to problems in plugin API:

 * Visible region draws incorrectly when first and last line visible in
   editor are both folded

Due to insufficient plugin API (or maybe I'm just dumb and can't find things):

 * Does not draw column-mode (rectangular) selection correctly
 * Does not hide folded regions
 * Does not highlight highlighted regions (like breakpoints, Highlight
   Usages results)
 * Does not show syntax coloring
